# Multi-robot tour guide
This repository simultaneously solves a bipartite matching and vehicle routing problem to match human with the correct robot and meanwhile generate the robot tours.

The goal is to maximize the satisfied human requests (some places of interest to visit) with the generated matching and routes.

## Run an example
```bash
mkdir temp
python3 example_main.py
```
